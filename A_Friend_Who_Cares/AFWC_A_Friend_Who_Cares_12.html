<b><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">A Friend Who
Cares is a Friend Who... Spanks Bare! - Chapter 12</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US"></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">When Kenny and Vicky's moms returned from their walk along the beach,
they were not at all surprised to find a pouting Vicky parked in a corner of
the condo's living room with her red bottom on display. They briefly
complimented Kenny -who was reading a book on one of the living room's sofas-
for acting upon whatever naughtiness the misbehaving girl had now caused,
without even asking for specifics. Then they stepped into the kitchen
discussing their options for lunch, as if Vicky's spanking was something so
casual and ordinary that it barely registered as an afterthought.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Behind both moms came Lucy, who wasted no time to start giggling and
taunting her punished older sister. Vicky grumbled and fumed, but didn't dare
talk back, or else she would risk earning a new dose of that awful leather sandal.
Kenny let Lucy have her fun, since he knew it would embarrass Vicky further and
he considered it part of her punishment.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Then Lindsey stepped out from one of the bedrooms, wearing fresh
clothes. She had taken a long shower and looked definitely cheerful. She
giggled at Vicky's predicament and took a seat beside Kenny, holding his hand.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"It looks like you had quite a workout, boyfriend,&#8221; Lindsey said,
staring at Vicky&#8217;s glowing buns. &#8220;You must be even hungrier than I am!"
Lindsey said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty hungry," Kenny said. "Mom is cooking
something, I think. Vicky, you've had enough cornertime, go put some clothes on
so we can all have something to eat."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Maybe we're having some roasted ham," Lindsey said.
"Even though Vicky already had her hams roasted!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lucy laughed and high-fived Lindsey. "Good one!" Lucy said. "You're
a natural, girl! I think I'm starting to like you."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Covering her breasts and privates as best she could, Vicky hurried to
one of the bedrooms, grumbling under her breath.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Everyone sat at the table for lunch. Most of them seemed to be happy
about the trip so far, and the conversation turned light and cheerful. Only
Vicky was frowning, and she kept fidgeting over her hard, wooden seat, due to
her bottom's unrelenting sting.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">After lunch, there were some chores to be done around the condo and
everyone was given a task to do. Kenny was washing the dishes when Lindsey, who
was in the process of sweeping the floor, approached him and whispered in his
ear: "Hey boyfriend, I think Lucy just pulled a disappearing act without
doing her share of work, probably hoping no one would notice. Does your...
hard-handed authority apply to her, too?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"What? She's gone?" Kenny said, as he dried his hands with a
kitchen towel. "Yes, it definitely applies to her, too. And I'm about to
apply a painful reminder to that girl's sneaky little butt!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey giggled and did a little jump. "Awesome! Can I watch? Can
I?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Um, sure I guess..." Kenny said, arching an eyebrow.
Lindsey's level of excitement was a little surprising to him. "We can
finish our own chores after we deal with her."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Great! Let's go find the brat," Lindsey said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">They found Lucy relaxing on a beach lounger in the pool area, giggling
as she used her cell phone to check her facebook account.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Reading some pretty funny posts, huh?" Kenny said, standing
behind her with Lindsey at his side. Lindsey mimicked his no-nonsense posture,
with hands at the waist, but she couldn&#8217;t take the smile off her face.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yeah, listen to this one..." Lucy started to say. Then she
realized she'd been caught and turned around in surprise. "Oh! I... I was
just, uh..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Hiding from your chores, I know," Kenny said. "Now your
bottom's going to pay the price. Let's go."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny grabbed her ear and carried her all the way back to the condo,
while Lucy protested and whined. A few kids who were swimming in the pool
laughed at the scene, and Lindsey merrily hopped along, looking rather pleased.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">They entered the condo, Kenny still tugging Lucy's ear, and the two moms
simply shook their heads and chuckled at the sight, not bothering to stop
working on their own chores or ask about Lucy's current misdeed. Vicky chuckled
at her younger sister, too, as she kept folding towels and arranging other
items.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The three kids entered one of the bedrooms and closed the door from the
inside. Kenny sat down on the bed and swiftly pulled Lucy across his lap, while
Lindsey took a seat on a nearby chair to watch the fireworks. Kenny easily
peeled off Lucy's bikini bottom, as the 12-year-old girl struggled uselessly
and whimpered, knowing very well what was about to happen.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I can see that you're already getting a nice tan," Kenny
said, looking at the girl's tan lines and wriggling bubble-butt. "But you
know you've just earned these cute buns of yours a nice, deep tanning, too. So
keep still!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny adjusted her a little and then the rain of smacks started pouring
over Lucy's bouncy rear end. On cue, the punished girl started kicking and
crying right away.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"WAAAAAAAA! WAAAAAAAA!" Lucy cried out, not bothering to plead
or protest any longer.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny spanked away vigorously, managing to keep the squirming girl in
place. As opposed to her older sister, Lucy bawled at the top of her lungs from
the very start, but Kenny did not let that make him spank any less hard or any
less fast. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">A few times during the punishment, his eyes spied Lindsey, who was
leaning forward on the chair. Grinning from ear to ear, her eyes sparkling,
Lindsey seemed to be delighted -even ecstatic- with the powerful spanking.
Kenny wondered about it and decided he should look into that later. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">His focus then returned to Lucy's reddened behind and he spanked and
spanked, not giving the screaming brat even a second's respite. Lucy just kept
making a huge fuss, crying loudly, swinging her legs and making a mess of tears
and snot all over her face.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">When the spanking was over, Kenny let Lucy do her spanking dance and
then walked toward the door. Lindsey had stood up but seemed to be enthralled
by Lucy's wild dancing, and Kenny had to call her three times before she
snapped out of it and followed him outside. Then they both finished their
chores and, minutes afterwards, they supervised Lucy as she finished her own
chores, still weeping softly and rubbing her burning bottom from time to time.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">A while later, the four kids were enjoying themselves in one of the
swimming pools. Both Vicky and Lucy were actually enjoying it a bit more than
the others, as the cool water helped with their recently warmed-up bottoms.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">A few other kids were in the pool, too. Two of them were a pair of twin
redheads who happened to be Lucy's classmates at school: Marky and Mandy, the
son and daughter of a marriage who were friends with Vicky and Kenny's moms.
The four adults relaxed on beach chairs near the pool, sharing drinks and
chatting cheerfully, while the kids got to know each other and played in the
water. Marky and Kenny raced each other underwater while the girls talked.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"You guys swim in the beach yet?" Lucy asked Mandy.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Not yet," Mandy said, brushing her wet, short, red hair aside
with a finger. "The sun is setting soon, though, so I guess we'll do that
tomorrow."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Maybe it's for the best," Vicky said, looking sideways at
Lindsey and snickering. "I heard they found some sea urchins at the beach
today. They can pretty painful, you know? Particularly if they sting you on a certain
plump, soft spot."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey caught Vicky's taunting and grumbled, but she wouldn't let the
dark-haired girl have the last laugh. "Yeah, maybe. But I also heard that
you could get a pretty good <i style="">tanning</i>
at the beach today. Particularly if you brought leather sandals, they said.
Weird, huh?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky's snickering turned into grumbles. Both girls stared at each other
with blazing eyes and gritted teeth, even as they secretly rubbed their bottoms
underwater, remembering the aforementioned experiences. Their tempers were burning
almost as much as their teenage rear ends had burned only a little while ago.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Huh? What was that all about?" Mandy whispered in Lucy's ear.
"Sea urchins and sandals?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lucy giggled. "Let's just say they're both finding the beach hotter
than they expected," she whispered back. Then her smile disappeared as she
remembered her own recent experience and secretly caressed her own bottom as
well. "I guess <span style="">we're</span> <i style="">all</i> finding it too hot, actually.
Listen, um... I heard we're having a barbecue with you guys tonight,
right?" she said, trying to change the subject.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yeah! Dad's cooking sausages and stuff. Maybe we can play some
board games or something. We brought a few."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Cool," Vicky said. "And maybe you can sit next to Marky,
Luce. How about that, huh?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Would... you... <i>shut&#8230; </i><span style="">up</span>?" Lucy muttered between her teeth.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Huh? What does she mean, Lucy?" Mandy said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Oh my god," Lindsey said, understanding and sensing the
opportunity to tease the younger girl. "She means that Lucy <i>likes</i>
Marky, isn't that right? She means that Lucy has a crush on him!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"She <i>what</i>?" Mandy said, "Oh my god, is that true,
Lucy?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lucy rolled her eyes and sighed. "Well&#8230; sort of..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Oh my <i style="">god</i>!" Mandy
said. "You have a crush on my brother! And you'd never told me about it?
We've been together at school since, like, kindergarten - my brother, you and
I!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I just thought you'd tell him, I guess," Lucy said. "I
mean, you guys are twins. You probably tell each other everything, right?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Whatever, this is <i>huge</i> news!&#8221; Mandy said, looking excited. &#8220;We
definitely gotta get you guys together!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Totally!" Lindsey agreed. "This is going to be
fun!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"H-hey, wait a minute!" Lucy said. "I'm... I'm not sure
that this is a good idea. I mean..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Does he like someone else, Mandy?" Vicky said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I don't think he likes anyone in particular right now," the
redhead said. "He's still too interested in sports and boy stuff, that's
all he ever talks about. But, I mean, I know for a fact that he's already
getting excited about girls..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"How do you know?&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;I mean, you're saying that he
doesn't talk about girls, so how do you...?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Mandy only giggled in response, looking at each of the three girls in
turn, and blushed softly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"She means she's seen him get a stiffie," Lindsey said,
snickering.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"A wh&#8230;? Oh!" Lucy said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Mandy giggled again. "Caught him watching porn on TV last week, with
a little tent in his pants. Then mom walked in and saw what he was watching.
She immediately pulled down his pants and briefs for a good spanking, and so I
confirmed what that little tent was.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky and Lindsey giggled, but Lucy just blushed and looked uncomfortable.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Plus," Mandy continued, shrugging her shoulders. "We see
each other naked all the time."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"You... you <i>what</i>?" Lucy said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Before Mandy could answer, the four girls were showered on their faces
with water. They turned to find that it was Kenny and Marky who were splashing
them and laughing as they did. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The girls retaliated with some splashing of their own. The war went on
for a little while, the six kids enjoying it, until Lucy felt too much water get
into her eyes and decided to get out of the line of fire, climbing out of the
pool. The other girls swiftly followed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The two boys celebrated their victory, cheering and high-fiving each
other. Standing just out of the pool, the girls were still laughing.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"We'll get you next time!" Mandy said to the boys, standing in
front of the other girls with a smile. Then she felt a curious breeze. She saw
the boys' faces become surprised, wondered what it was they were staring at...</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Then she realized it. She looked down to find her bikini bottom at her
ankles, a pair of hands letting it go after having lowered it. Her small patch
of red, wet pubes was now in plain sight.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"EEEEEEEEK!" Mandy shrieked. Then she hurried to pull up the
garment, setting it back into place.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Vicky!" Kenny said, accusingly. He couldn't believe that the
incorrigible girl was up to her pranks again, so soon after getting her bottom
blistered. He was already promising himself that she was not going to be able
to sit down for a <i style="">week</i> after this&#8230;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Uh... I'm right here," Vicky said, waving. She was standing a
few steps at Mandy&#8217;s left.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny frowned. It hadn't been Vicky? But then who...?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey stepped out from behind Mandy. They all stared at her in
disbelief. Lindsey? The role model of perfect behavior? Innocent, angelic
Lindsey?</span>
