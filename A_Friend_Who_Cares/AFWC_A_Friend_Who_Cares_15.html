<b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">A friend who cares is a friend
who... spanks bare! - Chapter 15</span></b>

<br><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></b>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After the barbecue, the adults opened a bottle of wine
and lounged on the beach. Night had finally fallen and it seemed like a
particularly dark evening, so Marky, Mandy and Lucy decided to go back into the
condo to play board games. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Kenny thought that the time had come for the &#8216;talk&#8217; he
had promised Lindsey &#8211; the one where his hand would be doing most of the
talking. But then he realized that the blond girl was nowhere to be seen. She
had sneaked away when he wasn't looking! Kenny grumbled to himself as he
searched for her, walking all around the condos. He swore that her butt would
pay handsomely for escaping like this.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">After he'd swept the entire complex, as well as inside
the two families' condos, he decided to look for her further down the beach. He
walked along the seashore, the stars providing his only illumination. He smiled
when he finally glimpsed a female silhouette up ahead, sitting on the sand and
staring at the rolling waves.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"There you are!" he said, and the girl
turned to look at him. But as he approached and got a better view, he realized
that it was not Lindsey at all, but Vicky, wearing a rather gloomy face, as if
she was a bit melancholy. "Oh, hey Vicks. I was actually looking for..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Misplaced your prize girlfriend, huh?"
Vicky said. "Yeah, I didn't think you were looking for me." She
turned back toward the sea.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Kenny stared at her for a moment and thought <span style="">&nbsp;</span>that for some reason she looked quite lovely
in the near-darkness (not that he didn't find her lovely under the light, too,
which he definitely did). </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Um, well, as a matter of fact..." Kenny
said as he sat next to her. "I wanted to talk to you, too, you know?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Oh man, I'm still feeling the last 'talk' we
had," she said, suddenly worried. "That sandal was pretty vicious. So
what did I do this time? Oh wait, I remember. You still owed me a 'talk' for my
history quiz results."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Uh... no, I don't mean that kind of
'talk'," he said. "I meant actual talk, with just words. No spanking
involved."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Oh well, that's a relief. Ok, so what's on your
mind?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Kenny followed her gaze toward the black ocean. Given
what he was about to say, he thought that he was supposed to feel nervous, but
for some reason he felt completely relaxed. No wonder people come to the beach
for relaxation, he thought. But then he realized it wasn't the beach&#8217;s work at
all: It was simply being with his BFF. Vicky made him feel comfortable in ways
that nothing else could.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Well, I guess I have wanted to tell you this for
a while now," he said. "It's about Lindsey."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Vicky sighed. "Figures."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"No, I mean...! It's not really about Lindsey,
it's more about me. It's about... look, you know my parents are divorced,
right?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Of course."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"And you know it wasn't pretty when it happened.
It was, like, the worst thing ever. It scared me. And I'm still scared."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"You, scared? I didn't think anything could scare
you. But I don't get it, I mean, I get that it was a bad time for you, but it
happened years ago. What are you still scared of?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I'm scared of more parts of my life falling
apart. I mean, it can happen at any time, right? I'm scared of losing more
things I love. Losing more people I love."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"But why would you lose...?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I'm scared of losing you, Vicks."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Vicky turned to look at him, an ice cube sliding down
her throat. For an instant, she didn't recognize him and she didn't know why.
Then she realized that he looked vulnerable, somehow. She&#8217;d never seen him
looking vulnerable.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"But wh.... me? I'm not..." Vicky started to
say, speaking before getting her thoughts straight. She forced herself to
focus. "What do you mean <i style="">losing</i>
me? Why would you lose me?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Because that's what happens when you get too
close to someone?" he said, somewhere between a statement and a question.
"That's what happened to my parents, anyway. They got married and had a
kid and it all made them closer to each other. And they couldn't take it, being
so close."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Vicky thought that she should say something, but she
couldn't think of what to say. She felt her previously-hardened heart gently
melting like ice cream under the afternoon sun. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"And you and I are way too close," he
continued. "I mean, we are the best BFFs ever! I care for you a lot and I know
that you care for me a lot and... and I just can't bear the thought of losing
you. So we can't get any closer, you see?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"But... but I thought&#8230; "Vicky started to
say. She&#8217;d been afraid of losing him, too. But it was because of Lindsey. Vicky
thought that Lindsey would start taking him away from her life. She never
imagined that Kenny was afraid of the same thing, even if for different
reasons.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Listen, we are 14 years old," he said.
"And we want to have girlfriends and boyfriends and all that stuff. I
mean, it's probably good for us to experience that part of our lives, right? We
<i style="">should</i> have boyfriends and
girlfriends and learn about love and relationships and stuff. But we're going
to <i style="">lose</i> those boyfriends and
girlfriends eventually.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;We are?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;At this age? Sure we will. Either in good or bad
terms, but it's going to end and we'll move on to new relationships later,
right? So Lindsey, she... I mean, I <i style="">do</i>
care for her and I think she will be a wonderful girlfriend. And I don't know
if she and I will be together for years or maybe just days or whatever, but I
want to <i style="">try</i> having a girlfriend. And
I guess it will hurt when I lose Lindsey, because, like I said, I will probably
lose her at some point. But I don&#8217;t want to lose <i style="">you, </i>Vicks. You&#8217;re too important to me."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Oh, shit," Vicky said. "Kenny,
I..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I know," he said, interrupting her. "I
know I'm a coward and whatever. I know this is unfair to Lindsey or to you or
both of you or whatever. But I'd rather be a coward and unfair, but still have
you. And I guess you'll probably think the worst about me after saying all of
this, but I just thought you had to know. I just thought I had to tell
you."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Vicky looked at him for a moment, in silence, until
she realized that he was done.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I want to have a boyfriend, too," she finally
said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Huh?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I want to have a boyfriend, just like you have a
girlfriend," she said, and he was surprised to find a smile on her face.
"And I was thinking Danny Thompson would be a good choice for me, what do
you think?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Danny? Well, he's... I mean..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I don't want to lose you, either. And I think I
might hate you for everything you just said, but the truth is that I guess I&#8217;m
a coward, too. I&#8217;ve been afraid of losing you, too, you know?&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Me? No way, you don&#8217;t have to worry about me.
I&#8217;m the most stubborn BFF ever.&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">She giggled. "We'll be fine, right?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I think so, yeah."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Training kiss?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Training kiss."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">A training kiss, as they&#8217;d kissed before. A kiss
supposed to train them so they could deliver decent kisses to their
girlfriend/boyfriend. A kiss that didn&#8217;t count as a real kiss, since it was
between BFFs. Kenny thought that he should feel bad about it since he now had a
girlfriend. And he did feel bad. But it also felt right. It was crazy. But he
did it anyway.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">And so they kissed. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">And they were warm. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">And they were still. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">And they were fine.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Then they pulled apart and Kenny smiled. "I feel
great," he said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Me, too."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"So, uh... what should we do now?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Vicky sighed and her smile twisted, but remained.
"I guess we should go have that other 'talk'. The one about my quiz
results."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Oh, right. I guess we should."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"So I guess you'll probably keep on spanking me
forever, too, right? You&#8217;re my BFF and also my BSF."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"Best Spanker Forever. You bet I am," he
said and laughed. "Don't worry, my hand will never stray too far from your
naughty bottom."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">"I'm not worried about that," she said, her
eyes sparkling. "Not anymore."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US"></span>
