<br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">A friend who cares is a
friend who... spanks bare! - Chapter 9</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US"></span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"But... but is there room enough for her?" Vicky said, from
the second-row seat of the car, where she was sitting next to Kenny. Behind
them, in the third-row seat, was Lucy. At the front of the car, Kenny's mom sat
in the pilot seat and Vicky's mom sat in the copilot seat. Both <a name="_GoBack"></a>moms wore sunglasses and, for some reason, Vicky thought
that it made them seem stricter, but she didn't care too much at the moment.
"I mean, where would she sleep? In the couch?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"That's not a problem at all," Kenny's mom said as she drove,
heading toward Lindsey's house. "The condo is big enough. There are four
bedrooms, so there will definitely be room for everyone."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"But... but..." Vicky went on. "H-how about food? Did we
bring enough food for six people?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Are you kidding?" Vicky's mom said, turning her head halfway
around. "We brought food for TWELVE people. You know that because you
helped me pack it. What's this all about? Are you just trying to be annoying
from the very beginning of the trip? I packed your wooden hairbrush, you
know?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"N-no, it's just... I just thought this was a family trip, that's
all," Vicky said, fidgeting at the mention of the hairbrush. "I mean,
Kenny and his mom are practically family, we've known each other since forever,
but Lindsey is... she's..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"She's my girlfriend," Kenny said, interrupting her. "And
our moms already said that she could come. What's the problem? I thought you
liked Lindsey."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Like her?" Vicky said. "I mean, sure, I can hang out
with her at the mall or something, but I wouldn't go as far as to say I like
her."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Why not?" Kenny said, looking annoyed. "She's fun, and
smart, and..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Smart?" Vicky said, with a mocking smile. "Oh, pleeeaaase!
She has a hard time in every class at school! And she's always talking about reality
shows and stupid stuff!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"You watch reality shows, too!" Kenny said. "And she IS
smart, you just don't know her that well."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"And she'll be our guest in this trip, so stop talking about her
like that this instant, Missy, or else!" Vicky's mom said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I don't know her? Of course I know her!" Vicky said, answering
Kenny&#8217;s remarks, as if she hadn't heard her mom's warning. "I know she's
an AIRHEAD! Your darling new girlfriend is a real airhead, you blockhead!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"All right, that's it!" Vicky's mom said, rummaging through
her purse. "Now where did I put that hairbrush? Kenny, be a dear and warm
up my daughter's seat, will you? So she can learn what happens to rude little
girls who don't settle down when they are told to. And I don't mean her CAR
seat, of course."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"With pleasure, ma'am," Kenny said as he scooted to the middle
of the long seat and then pulled Vicky across his lap, taking her by surprise.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"H-HEY! WAIT A MINUTE!" Vicky said, as she felt Kenny get a
firm grip around her waist. "NO, PLEASE! WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
STREET, PEOPLE CAN SEEEEE!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"The car's windows are heavily tinted," Kenny said as he
easily peeled Vicky's lycra shorts -along with her underwear- down to her
knees, revealing her plump, naked buns. "So don't worry, no one will be
able to see through. There&#8217;s no need for the hairbrush, ma'am, I think I can
handle this quickly enough."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"NOOO, PLEEAASE!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I'll start looking for the aloe vera, big sis!" Lucy said
between giggles, leaning over from the backseat to enjoy the show. "It
looks like you're going to need it way before we hit the beach!" </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOWW! STOP! OOWW! I'LL BEHAVE! I'LL BEHAAAVE!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Do a good job, Kenny," Vicky's mom said, without turning
around. "So she'll think twice before being rude again in this trip."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Whatever you say, ma'am," Kenny said, and doubled the
strength of his smacks, raining over Vicky's bare bottom.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOWW! I PROMIIIISE! OOWW! OOOOWWW!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"These vinyl seats are really going to be uncomfortable after this
is over...." Lucy said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Are we there yet, Kenny? And I&#8217;m not talking about the trip,"
Lucy said, and giggled.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Not really, Lucy. We're only about halfway through your sister's lesson."
Kenny answered.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOWAAA! I'M SORRYYY! OOWAAA! OOWAAAAA!&#8221;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"So, do you think the Hendersons are going to make it?"
Vicky's mom said to Kenny's mom, engaging in casual conversation while the
dramatic sounds of the spanking continued right behind them. "They said
their condo would be quite close to ours. Maybe we can have a barbecue
together, tonight or maybe tomorrow night."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOOOOOWW! NOOOO MOOOOORE!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"That's a splendid idea!" Kenny's mom said. "They're a
very nice couple, aren't they, the Hendersons? And their children are handsome,
too, even though they&#8217;re absolute rascals. Did you know that Molly Davis once
told me that the Henderson children had set her backyard on fire? I hope their
parents have taken them down a peg or two since then."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOOOWW! KENNY PLEASE! OOOOWW! PLEEEAAAASE!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Speaking of Molly," Vicky's mom said. "Have you seen her
new haircut? It's simply divine."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOWAAAAA! I'LL BEEEHAAAAAVE! OOWAAAAA!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The spanking went on for a little longer, while both moms gossiped in
the front seats and Lucy kept taunting her older sister from the back seat. A
few blocks before they arrived at Lindsey's house, the spanking finally ended.
Kenny pulled Vicky's underwear and lycra shorts back up, and Vicky sat up. She
started a comical sitting-variation of the spanking dance, squirming and
wiggling her burning behind over the seat, as if an army of ants had made its
way into her undies. She cried, too, but when she realized that they were close
to Lindsey's house she made an effort to reduce her crying, managing to turn it
into a mixture of whimpering and soft weeping.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The car stopped in front of a large, beautiful house, and Kenny stepped
out to go pick up his girlfriend.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I g-guess I'd better sit in the- *sniff* -in the back with
Lucy..." Vicky said, not wanting Lindsey to see her red, tearful face and reach
some conclusions.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky moved to the third-row seat, sitting (and still squirming) next to
Lucy, who kept giggling at her. A minute later, Kenny put Lindsey's suitcase in
the trunk of the car, and then him and Lindsey sat on the second-row seat.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Hi, everyone!" Lindsey said, clearly excited. "Thanks
for inviting me! This is going to be lots of fun!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Right... fun..." Vicky mumbled under her breath, frowning.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Welcome aboard, Lindsey," Kenny's mom said, smiling at the pretty
blonde girl. "Now let's go chase some sun, shall we?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Hi, Vicky!" Lindsey said, turning around to greet the pouting
girl, as the car started moving. "What's the matter? You look a little
upset. And flushed, too. AND you're sniffling. Are you feeling under the
weather?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"More like she's feeling the leather," Lucy said, giggling.
"The car seat's leather, that is!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Huh?" Lindsey said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Shut up, runt!" Vicky said. "Um... don't worry Lindsey,
I'll- *sniff* -I'll be fine. And, uh, congratulations on your new relationship,
I guess..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Thanks!" Lindsey said, her clear eyes sparkling. "Isn't
it great? I guess you and me are going to be like sisters from now on!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Sisters, right..." Vicky said, forcing out a smile to meet
Lindsey's effervescent cheerfulness.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey turned back to chat with Kenny, and Vicky noticed that they were
holding hands. There had to be something she could do to show Kenny just how
much of an airhead Lindsey was, she owed her BFF that much. Yes, she would find
a way; there would be plenty of opportunities at the beach. A devilish smile
crossed her face, as her confidence started crawling back. She squirmed in her
seat and endured Lucy's mocking faces. And she planned.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">About an hour later, they had arrived to the small beach town. The
condominium complex was located at the far side of town, so it enjoyed some
relative privacy and its beach was never too crowded. The condos themselves
were organized in several small buildings with three or four condos each, which
made the entire complex something of a maze, with two swimming pools somewhere
in between.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">From the parking lot, they walked to the front office, got the keys to
their condo and then headed toward it. As they walked, Vicky thought that the
whole place looked quite nice, the buildings' architecture showing a somewhat
rustic, southwestern style that seemed to fit right with the ocean's breeze and
sound.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">When they had found their condo and stepped inside, Vicky learned that
Kenny's mom hadn't been kidding: It was definitely huge! As they explored it,
Kenny's mom explained that this had been, in fact, two condos originally, but
they were now connected by a single door and rented as one. It was decided that
Vicky's family would sleep in the two bedrooms from one half of the condo,
while Kenny, his mom and Lindsey would sleep in the other half (which further
separated Kenny from Vicky, in Vicky's mind).</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Can we go to the beach now, mom? Can we?" an excited Lucy
said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Sure, just don't forget the sunscreen."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky stepped into the bathroom and slipped into her red, once-piece
swimsuit. Then she inspected the damage from her earlier spanking in the
mirror, pulling up the bottom of her swimsuit in order to reveal more of her
well-spanked buns. The swimsuit's color managed to camouflage the redness a
little, although it probably wouldn't help much if someone looked at her bottom
from a close distance. She hoped the ocean's water would help her bottom regain
its natural color quickly enough.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The bathroom's door swung open and Lindsey &#8211;already in her pink bikini-
stepped inside, faster than Vicky was able to react. "Oh! Sorry, Vicky, I
didn't know you were here. I was just..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey's words trailed off as her eyes found Vicky's bottom. Vicky
blushed and hurried to turn around, but it was too late.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&#8220;Why... why is your bottom so red?" Lindsey said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I, um, I..." Vicky said, scrambling for an excuse. "I...
I accidentally sat on the stove this morning?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"You what?" Lindsey said, with an expression of disbelief.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky sighed. "All right, I was SPANKED," she said, feeling
completely embarrassed, but somehow a little relieved after revealing her
secret. "Happy now?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"You were WHAT? You mean... like, spanked on your BOTTOM?"
Lindsey said, looking as if she was struggling to believe it.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Of course on my bottom!" Vicky said, starting to feel a
little annoyed.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Oh my god," Lindsey said, placing a hand over her mouth, as
if shocked. "You&#8230; you get spanked at your age? Like a five-year-old? So
you, like, misbehaved this morning and then got spanked by-"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"-her mom," Kenny said, stepping into the bathroom and
finishing Lindsey's sentence for her. "She gets spanked by her mom every
now and then. It's obviously kind of embarrassing, so please don't tell anyone
at school, ok?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, of course," Lindsey said. "Oh my god, this is
incredible! Getting spanked at our age, I mean. Don't worry, Vicky, your
secret's safe with me."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yeah, thanks..." Vicky said, looking down and wrapping her
arms around herself.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Don't be so bashful, we're going to be like sisters now,
remember?" Lindsey said. "Anyway, let's hurry to the beach.
C'mon!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey smiled and hurried out of the bathroom, leaving the other two
kids alone.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I guess I should thank you for the save," Vicky told Kenny.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Don't mention it," Kenny said, shrugging. "It was going
to be hard keeping it a secret from her anyway, now that she's my girlfriend.
At least we can hide the fact that your regular spanker is actually a boy your
own age."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yeah, I'm starting to enjoy the perks of having a new
'sister'," Vicky said, in a sarcastic tone.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Like she said, let's just forget about it and hit the beach. Let's
go!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">They walked out of the bathroom. At the far end of the living room, a
sliding glass door led directly to a brief patch of grass outside, and then to
the beach. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The four kids splashed into the ocean and Vicky's bottom found some
relief in the cool water. As she let her rear end chill, her temper was still
steaming hot - she was ready to strike back against her new, self-appointed
'sister'! So Lindsey thought that she could embarrass her in front of Kenny?
Well, two could play the same game. Vicky's smile twisted and she submerged
until the water covered the bottom half of her face, feeling very much like a
shark stalking its unsuspecting prey&#8230;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The four kids were having a good time at the beach. They submerged and
re-emerged from the water, and splashed each other playfully. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">They were all laughing and distracted with their splashing, with the
exception of Lucy, who had walked out of the water to go get some rubber foam
balls to play with. Vicky thought that the moment was a window of opportunity
to cause some trouble for Lindsey. She positioned herself behind Lindsey and
waited until Kenny was underwater and Lindsey was about to submerge herself. As
Lindsey jumped to dive underwater, Vicky's fingers took hold of one of the
strings of her bikini top, and so Lindsey&#8217;s dive caused the knot to come
undone. Then Vicky quickly moved away from the crime scene.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny resurfaced first, with a radiant smile on his face. The sun shone
over his wet, tan skin and Vicky thought that he looked even cuter when wet.
Then Lindsey surfaced, with a smile of her own, and Kenny's smile suddenly
disappeared.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"What?" said Lindsey, still smiling at Kenny, who now had a
bewildered look on his face. "What is it? Is it something on my
hair?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Then Lindsey realized that he was not staring at her golden hair or even
at her face, but somewhere lower. She looked down to see what he was staring so
stupefied at...</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"EEEEEEK!" cried Lindsey, hurrying to cover her bare chest
with both arms. Her bikini top had come off, giving Kenny a fascinating show.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky couldn't help herself and started laughing, thoroughly enjoying
Lindsey's embarrassment. She confirmed, once again, just how much she enjoyed
making other people blush. So the blonde princess thought she could invite
herself to their beach trip? So she thought that she could invade what was
supposed to be Kenny and Vicky's quality time? Well, she was going to find that
payback was a bitch.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Sorry! I'm sorry!" Kenny said, coming out of his stupor and
looking away as he covered his eyes. "I didn't mean... I d-didn't mean to
see!" He blushed just as deeply as Lindsey, which Vicky enjoyed, too.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey looked around until she found her bikini top floating nearby.
She picked it up and hastily put it back on, taking care not to show anything
again.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"It's... it's ok," Lindsey said, still looking quite
mortified. "It must have slipped off with the water. It happens, I guess.
You can look now."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny looked at Lindsey. Then he looked at Vicky. Then he looked at
Lindsey again. He seemed no to know what to say or do next. Lindsey didn't,
either. It was an awkward moment for both of them and Vicky found herself
enjoying it greatly.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I found them!" Lucy said, as she walked back into the water,
carrying a couple of hand-size rubber foam balls. Vicky silently cursed at her younger
sister for ending the delightfully awkward moment.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Um, g-great!" Kenny said, glad for the chance to change
topics. "Let's play catch! You come with me, Lucy."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny and Lucy moved away to get some distance between themselves and
the two other girls, in order to throw the balls from a distance. Vicky took
notice that Kenny had asked Lucy, and not Lindsey, to join him. She thought
that he was probably still shy from what had just happened, and so he probably wanted
to get a little distance from Lindsey at the moment. Good. Anything that would
pull them apart was good news, in Vicky&#8217;s judgment.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OMG, that was soooo <span style="">embarrassing</span>!"
Lindsey said to Vicky, once they were out of Kenny's earshot. "Can you
believe what just happened? And on the first day of our new relationship!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yeah, it's probably a bad sign," Vicky said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"W-what? Do you mean, a bad sign for my relationship with
Kenny?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky shrugged and twisted her lips. "Well, I'm just saying, you
know, bad stuff happens when there's a bad vibe going around. Some people just
don't work together, I guess."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Are... are you serious? You think that Kenny and I... that it
won't work between us?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Hey, it was just a bad sign, that's all I'm saying. Just one, so
far. If more bad stuff starts happening these days, then you might want to
start doing some serous thinking about this new relationship. It's all about conflicting
auras and energies, you know? My aunt is always talking about that. Gotta watch
the signs, the energies."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Energies, right..." Lindsey said, arching an eyebrow at Vicky
as if not entirely convinced. As if a little suspicious, maybe?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Catch!" Kenny shouted from a distance, and the girls'
attention turned skyward, where the two balls were flying toward them.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The kids played catch for a while and soon enough they were all having
fun again. Too soon, for Vicky's taste. She watched Lindsey smiling and
realized that the awkward moment was getting further and further away from
them. She though that she needed to do something that lingered further.
Something that stung for longer.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Then fate rewarded her, or so she concluded when she swam to pick up one
of the balls that she had failed to catch, and she saw something underwater.
She blessed the water's clarity as she was able to clearly see the sea urchin
lying on the sand. She had been talking about signs to Lindsey, not really
believing in it at all, but now here was one: A sign that the universe was
conspiring to help in her naughty quest. A weapon handed to her with perfect
timing. Perhaps her Aunt Brunhilda was not that crazy, after all.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">She looked back and confirmed that Lindsey was still distracted with the
game. Then, with a wicked smile, she reached down and touched the small sea
urchin with the rubber foam ball. She saw that the sea urchin got stuck on the
ball and then she started swimming back slowly and quietly toward her
unsuspecting target, in a very shark-like manner, her black hair flowing
snake-like across the water as she went. She could hear the '<i>Jaws</i>' theme
song in her head as she approached her prey, and silently thanked her mom for
being such a fan of old horror movies.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey laughed as she saw Kenny miss a catch and splash into the water
spectacularly. "C'mon, boyfriend, wake up!" she called out. "It
looks like even Lucy has better refle-EEEEEYOOOOOOOOWW!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey jumped up higher than Vicky would have anticipated. Vicky
immediately committed to memory the exquisitely funny and absolutely delightful
(to Vicky) image of Lindsey in mid-jump, complete with the small sea urchin
stuck on her bottom's right cheek (the ball had been shaken off the spiny
thing), as well as her comical expression of intensely painful surprise. It
took a great effort from Vicky not to burst out laughing right there and then.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">In a panic, the blonde girl splashed out of the water in long strides,
not even waiting to investigate what it was that had just stung her. The small sea
urchin bobbed up and down as she walked, still stuck on her plump posterior.
Kenny hurried toward his girlfriend, and Vicky walked out as well, biting her
lips from the inside of her mouth as she kept trying very hard not to laugh.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOOWW! OOOWW! TAKE IT OFF! TAKE IT OOOOOOOFF!" cried Lindsey,
once she had turned her head to discover the spiny sphere stuck to her rear
end.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny quickly picked up one of their towels, grabbed the sea urchin with
it and pulled it off his girlfriend's teenage behind.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOOOOOOWW!" Lindsey cried out, as the thing was pulled out in
a less than gentle manner. Tears were already forming in her eyes.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Sorry! Sorry!" Kenny said. "Oh man, there's... there's
still spines stuck on your bottom. Let's go get mom so she can-"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"No!" Lindsey said, interrupting him. "I don't want her
to see this! Oooww... It's embarrassing! Besides, oooww... I d-don't want to be
a party-pooper in your family trip, Ken. Oooww..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Of course you're not a party-pooper, this is just an
accident!" Kenny said. "Anyway, if you're really that embarrassed, we
don't go have to go there. Maybe Vicky can pull the spines off."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Sure!" Vicky said, already planning to do it in the most
painful way possible. "I can lend a hand, don't worry!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"N-no, I want <i>you</i> to do it, Kenny..." Lindsey said.
"You're my boyfriend now and I want you to take care of me. Maybe... maybe
this happened so you can start taking care of me, you know? In a very, VERY
painful way, yes, but maybe we can still see this as a good sign, right Vicky?
Ooooooww..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky was speechless. How could Lindsey see this as something potentially
good? How can <i>anyone</i> see the bright side in such a thing? But this was
classic Lindsey, always seeing the good in everything, always shining a bright
light wherever she went. It was absolutely frustrating! She was even turning
around Vicky's speech about bad signs, which was even more irritating!
"R-right," Vicky reluctantly answered. "If you say so..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Well, ok then," Kenny said, sitting on a towel over the sand.
"I guess we'd better get to it. Get across my knees."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey hesitated at first, but the sting of the spines on her fanny
urged her forward, since she wanted to get them off as soon as possible, so she
obediently lay down across Kenny's lap. Watching the prickled bottom before him,
Kenny suddenly found the image very familiar. He swallowed, blushed, and
realized that his hand was itching &#8211; their positioning made it feel very much like
a spanking moment. And the close-up helped confirm something that he had known
beforehand: Lindsey had an incredibly gorgeous bottom! He delicately pulled up
the bottom hem of Lindsey's bikini, in order to reveal more of her shapely,
milky-white buns (definitely whiter than Vicky's tan skin, he thought), unintentionally
giving Lindsey a wedgie in the process.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"H-HEEEEY!" Lindsey cried out in embarrassment. "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Sorry Lindsey, I have to uncover the affected area as much
possible," Kenny said. "Please keep still, this is delicate
work."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"O-ok, go on... *sniff*" Lindsey said, still weeping softly
from the stinging pain. "I trust you."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky saw that the words brightened up Kenny's face, filling him with
confidence, and she grumbled through her teeth in exasperation. What was this,
freaking 90210? She wanted to vomit.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny reached out and carefully took hold of one of the spines between
thumb and forefinger. Then he started pulling it out slooowlyyy...</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OooooOOOOOWW! Lindsey cried out, as the flesh pulled out a little,
along with the spine. Then the spine was plucked out completely and her flesh
returned to its rightful place. Vicky imagined hearing a funny sound as the
spine came out: *PING!* "OOOOWW! OH SHIT IT HUUUURTS!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">'Shit'? Did she say 'shit'? Had Lindsey Graham -princess of every known
virtue- just cursed?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Um, I... I mean..." Lindsey said, blushing. "I d-didn't
mean to curse..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny chuckled. "Don't sweat it, it's the least you could do under
the circumstances. I know I would be cursing lots worse, in your place!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lindsey forced a smile and looked downward, trying to hide her blushing
face. Vicky loved the fact that Kenny could now start learning that his delicate
princess wasn't diamond-perfect after all. Cursing was a good first step, and
Vicky wondered how much dirt she could dig out of the blonde, 14-year-old girl,
until Kenny could realize that she was a mistake for him.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OO-OO-OOWW!" Lindsey cried out as the second spine was
plucked out. Tears were now flowing down her cheeks and creating wet spots on
the sand below her face. "Oh god, it hurts!" *PING!* OOOOOWW! H-how
many more...?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Um..." Kenny said, not sure how to answer the question.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Well, what do you think, Lucy?" Vicky asked her younger
sister, who seemed to be enjoying the show, too. "You've always been good
at math, care to guess?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I'd say... about two hundred and fifty, maybe?" Lucy said and
started giggling.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"WHAAAT?" Lindsey said, horrified.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I'm sorry Lindsey, but seriously, that thing left a lot of
spines!" Kenny said. "We'll be here for a while. Just try to be
patient."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"YEEEE-OOOOOOWW! I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IIIIIIIT!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOOOWW! OOOOWW!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"So what do you guys want to do later?" Vicky said, relaxing
over the fresh, wet sand and trying to make small talk, as if nothing out of
the ordinary was going on, even though she was greatly enjoying Lindsey's
howling. She though that Lindsey&#8217;s little-girl voice made her cries sound even
funnier.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOOWAAAAAAAAA!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"How about sandcastles?" Lucy said, taking a cue from her
sister. "I mean, Lindsey's bottom looks like it would make a nice wall of <i>spikes</i>,"
she giggled.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"WAAAAAAA! OOWAAAAAAA!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I'd say it looks like you're starting a very <i>prickly</i>
relationship, Kenny!" Vicky said, giggling along her sister. "Good
thing you're such a great fanny doctor."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OO-OO-OOOWW! SHIT-SHIT-SHIT-SHIT!</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Such a dirty mouth!" Lucy said. "I guess you'd expect
that in such a <i>thorny</i> situation,"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"WAAAAAAAAAA!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Her dialogue may be filthy, but she's proving to be a good
actress," Vicky said. "I'd never seen such a good impression of a <i>pin
cushion</i>!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Simmer down, you two!" Kenny said. "I'm trying to get to
bottom of this problem, so stop it with your sharp, stinging comments!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOWAAAAAAAA! Y-YOU TOO, KENNY?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Oh! S-sorry!" Kenny said. "I didn't mean it like a pun,
I promise!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"W-whatever, just get it over with as quickly as possible!"
Lindsey said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Ok, ok, I'll pick up the pace."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">*PING!*... *PING!*... *PING!*... *PING!*... *PING!*... *PING!*...</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"OOOWW! OOOWW! OOWAAAAA! OOWW-OOWW-OOWWWWW! EEE-YOOOOOOWW!"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The spine-plucking went on for quite a while longer. Luckily for
Lindsey, the beach was almost empty at the time, and only a couple of other kids
wandered close to them and giggled at the proceedings. Lindsey had never felt
so humiliated in her life. Vicky and Lucy enjoyed the show immensely, giggling
all the while. Kenny was surprised to see that by the end, Lindsey was crying just
as loud as if she had received a good, hard spanking. He felt sorry for his
girlfriend and hoped that the rest of the day would pass without further incident.
First the accidental chest-flashing and now this. How could things start
getting out of hand so soon?</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">After every spine had been painfully plucked out of her stinging behind,
Lindsey did a brief spanking dance, even though she had not been exactly
spanked. She checked her hurting buns to find that small red spots were now
adorning the prickled zone. She continued crying softly, out of both pain and
embarrassment.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Easy now, easy," Kenny said, trying to calm her down.
"You've got to take a shower now. I'll check the internet on my phone,
back at the condo, to make sure that this kind of sea urchin is not venomous.
I'm pretty sure it isn't, but we'd better make sure just the same."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"V-venomous?" Vicky said, suddenly worried. "Oh man, I
wanted it to sting, but I didn't mean to poison h-"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"What?" Kenny said. "What. Did. You. Just. SAY?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Oh, brother..." Lucy said, as if she had understood. Lindsey
was still busy with her crying and hopping, so she hadn't heard Vicky's words.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Uh, I meant... I meant..." Vicky said, her mind racing for
words and her face turning red.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Kenny felt a buzzing in his ears and something in his brain waking up
and starting to work - the part of the brain that fitted puzzle pieces
together. He had been asking himself just how could so much trouble happen in
such a short span of time. He felt like an idiot for not suspecting it sooner.
The answer was almost always the same, when trouble happened around him: Vicky
was up to her usual naughtiness yet again. But this time, his new girlfriend had
been the target. Vicky had deliberately caused pain and shame to Lindsey, but
he was on to her now. He was going to stop this before the mischievous brat
managed to ruin their weekend getaway. And he knew that there was only one
language that Vicky understood.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Lindsey," Kenny said, his blazing eyes still locked with
Vicky's trembling ones. "Go take a shower while I check that on my phone.
Vicky will help me, she's good with internet searches."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"She is?" Lindsey said, still wincing from the pain.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"I...I am?" Vicky said, looking growingly worried.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Yes, she is," Kenny said. "You should see her when she
gets warmed up. And right now she's <i style="">definitely</i>
going to get warmed up, aren't you Vicks?"</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"Um, I g-guess so..." Vicky said, swallowing. She knew exactly
what he meant. "You... you go right ahead and take a long shower, Lindsey.
Kenny and I will get... to the bottom of this, I suppose..."</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">"That's exactly right," Kenny said.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Lucy giggled and wanted to join the 'search' party, but Kenny instructed
her to stay and build a sandcastle or something, or maybe go join their
mothers, who had gone for a long walk along the beach. The 12-year-old girl
grumbled at first, knowing that she was going to miss the fireworks. Then she
made some mocking faces to her older sister, teasing her about her upcoming <span style="">'warming up'</span>.</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">Vicky was already shivering with terrifying expectation when the three
kids started walking toward the condos. It was good thing that the twin-condos
were so big, she thought, since that way Lindsey could be showering at one
condo while Kenny and herself could get down to business in the other condo,
probably in one of the bedrooms. </span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang="EN-US">She lowered her head, resigned to her fate, as Kenny led both of them by
each of his hands. A 14-year-old boy with two blushing 14-year-old girls in
tow, both of whom were rubbing their rear ends with their free hands - one girl
due to the terrible sting already prickling her bottom, the other girl due to
the terrible sting that was about to prickle hers in a minute. Vicky thought
that this trip was getting off to a really explosive start!</span>
